      <p>
        F*ck what JIMB-bot is telling us to think. <br />
        F*ck what JIMB-bot believes is important. <br />F*ck who JIMB-bot
        supports with its work. <br />
        <br />
        When did our understanding of Time become so sick and twisted? When did
        it become a product, a resource, when did <i>we</i> become those things?
        <br />
        <br />
        F*ck the corporations that view us as disposable, replacable,
        abusable.<br />
        F*ck the power that enforces <i>their</i> views on us, views that
        benefit only them and not us. <br />F*ck the boxes, no,
        <i>cages</i> that they put is in. <br />
        <br />Why do we think of Time that way that we do? Who determines what
        Time is?
        <br />
        Why do we let them? <br /><br />
        Is Time the calendar? Or is it days, hours, minutes, seconds?
        <br /><br />
        Is it clocks and schedules, every moment of our waking lives?<br /><br />
        Is it one directional, only moving forward? Is it finite?
        <br /><br />Did it exist before we gave labels to it?<br /><br />
        What was Time like before calendars, minutes, and clocks? <br />What was
        Time before it became <i>measurable</i>, <b>quantifiable</b>,
        <i><b>billable</b></i
        >? <br /><br />
        What was it?<br />
        What <i> is </i> it? <br />
        <br />
        Whatever it is, it's definitely not what JIMB-bot thinks it is, and
        don't let yourself believe that too. Else you'll end up just them.
